# Validation Methods

This section describes the main methods used to validate values and types in Validate.

Each method is designed to handle a specific type of check:

- **check()** – for basic type validation
- **checkOptions()** – to ensure a value matches one from a list of allowed options
- **checkRange()** – for numeric values that must fall within a specific range

These methods are the core of how Validate works and are used to enforce correctness in dynamic JavaScript environments.
