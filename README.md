## ⚠️ License Notice

Starting from the next release, this project will be licensed under the **Apache 2.0** license.

I have no intention of closing the source code or limiting its use in any way — the project will remain **100% free**, both for personal and commercial use.

However, it's important to have **legal protection against third parties trying to create patents** based on this project — something the MIT license does not provide. That kind of risk could jeopardize the future of the project, and that's why this change is necessary.

This change **does not affect** anyone already using the library, whether in personal or commercial projects. All previous versions will remain under the original MIT license.

> **In short:** the project is still open and free — now it’s just better protected.

## What is Validate?

**Validate** is a simple and lightweight library for validating primitive types in JavaScript. It was originally created to solve a personal need for safely validating input data and to prevent bugs caused by JavaScript's lack of strict typing. It helps ensure that values from both external and internal sources match the expected types before being used.
